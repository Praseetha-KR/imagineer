title: "MetaRefresh<br>2014"
intro: '
From website to event branding, I covered the complete design artifacts required for MetaRefresh 2014 conference. The theme of the conference was <em>intersection between design and code</em>, which indeed aligned with my core skills and perspective, hence I thoroughly enjoyed the complete process. This website got <a target="_blank" href="https://designmodo.com/conference-website/">featured by designmodo</a> as a properly structured conference website.

        <h3>Stage&nbsp;Design</h3>
        <div>Proposed a 5-panel layout replacing the usual single flat panel backdrop. This covers the complete stage horizontally without leaving gaps. Center piece includes projector screen with frame-like border, left piece with conference branding, right piece with sponser logos and the rest of the area is with neutral color faded logos pattern - this is for a clean background in recorded videos.</div>

            <h3>Tshirt&nbsp;Design</h3>
            <div>A minimal text showing fused code + design in Raleway font. I felt this would be the best way to show code & design intersection. There was another candidate which had horizontal to vertical transition with reload icon indicating the direction change, but the chosen one is more lightweight.</div>

        <h3>Banners&nbsp;Design</h3>
        <div>Created a banner showing major web history milestones followed by MetaRefresh logo depicting it to be yet another major milestone in web history timeline üòù. I intended to make hand-drawn style icons here, but since I don't have a graphic tablet, just used basic shape tools in the editor. This was placed at the main entrance. The standee at the Auditorium entrance had jumbled characters of "metarefresh2014" in various fancy fonts.</div>

        <div>Signages were placed at various parts of the venue, the bright orange color made it noticeable quickly. Also made A4 printed feedback forms, it was made to mock tablet UI wireframe.</div>
