blurb: "My experience with Droidcon India conference"

This year's Droidcon India was the most memorable HasGeek event since I joined HasGeek one year ago. The sleepless nights extending over a month have come to an end.

Had lots of fun during conference and hackathon. Met some interesting people, helped with logistics and video recording, coding late nights without bean bag, completed Intel's image re-shuffle game, travelled in a tempo for the first time, drank countless energy booster tzinga, and last but not the least - the <a href="https://droidcon.in/2013/">event website</a> construction.

Overall it was super awesome experience!
