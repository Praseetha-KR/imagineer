Since the introduction of a new router to our home premises the previous one was lying around unused - it is TP-Link Archer C2 AC750 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router. I changed it to run as a Repeater, so that it can strengthen WiFi signal to the weak spots; Here is a note on how to do that.


<div>
    <blockquote><strong>TLDR:</strong> Since Archer C2 was running as a router earlier, I did a factory reset first. Then configured it in bridge mode connecting to the existing WiFi network and disabled DHCP mode.</blockquote>

### Steps to configure Archer C2 to run as a Repeater

##### 1. Hard reset router to factory default settings
Click on **WPS/Reset** button for about 10 seconds until the top panel LEDs flash. Then release the button and wait the for the router to reboot.

</div>

##### 2. Access Router's web interface
Once the router reboots you would be able to see C2's network (`TP-LINK_XXXX` format) in wireless networks list. SSID of the network along with Password/PIN is printed on the bottom panel of the router. Establish a connection with the new network and login to [http://tplinkwifi.net](http://tplinkwifi.net) with `admin:admin` as credentials.

</div>

##### 3. Change IP address in LAN settings
From `Network > LAN > LAN Settings`, change IP Address from `192.168.0.1` to `192.168.0.2`. It does a router auto reboot on save.

<div>
<blockquote>Assuming the network you want to connect to has IP address range <code>192.168.0.x</code>, so this IP address value can take <code>x</code> ranging from <code>2-254</code>. Make sure this IP doesn't collide with existing manual DHCP list in your router settings</blockquote>
</div>

After reboot, the TP-Link admin panel would be available at [http://192.168.0.2](http://192.168.0.2)

##### 4. Enable WDS bridging

**WDS** (Wireless Distribution System) is a system that enables the wireless interconnection of access points in a wireless network. Navigate to `Wireless 2.4GHz > Basic Settings` and check `enable WDS`, this will display more settings below the option.

<div>

    </figure>
</div>

Clicking on `scan` button will list APs within the area. Connect to your router's network which would autofill WDS `SSID` & `MAC address`; set the `Channel` to be same as the chosen WiFi network and also enter the `Password`. (Repeat the same process for `Wireless 5GHz` as well)

##### 5. Disable DHCP
Go to the page `DHCP > DHCP Settings` and select `disable` for DHCP Server.


(Optionally, You can also change repeater's `SSID:password` to be same as the router's WiFi)

That's all! Archer C2 has been **switched from router to repeater** mode ðŸ“¶
