Good bye WordPress. You have been nicer to me for the past 2 years. Thank you for your service.

I started diving into the world of binary digits when I was in 3rd year of college. For me, WordPress was one of the first things I learned with my very first computer - server and DB setup, markup and styling, domain and hosting, FTP, .. everything were new to me. I had installed and uninstalled hundreds of WP themes and plugins, each had both good and bad elements, simply wastage of time. But I could learn the basic pattern, usability and user experience from that process. Later those learnings paved my way to the web development field. 

WordPress is still a best CMS, but I'm tired of its updates attack! My search for a new blogging platform ended up with static site generators. This site has setup with <strong>Jekyll</strong> and supported by Boostrap, jQuery, Modernizr, HTML5 Boilerplate and Font Awesome. I enjoy this new freedom of customization!
