<!-- <style>strong{color:#f06;}</style> -->

Currently I'm reading "**Ogilvy on Advertising**", book written by the business advertizing wizard **David Ogilvy**, the most successful Ad-man of all the time. In the second chapter he has mentioned the steps on creating succesfull ads which sells. *These steps are equally well applicable to web design*, so I thought of listing out them here.

1. **Do your homework**
    - Study the product you are going to advertise
    - Find out what kind of advertising your competitors have been doing for similar products, and with what success.
    - Research among consumers (what they think about product, languages they use, attributes important to them, promises which would likey make them to buy your brand)

2. **Positioning**<br>
    What the product does, and who is for.

3. **Brand image**<br>
    Create personality of brand (brand image is an amalgum of many things - its name, packaging, price, style of its advertising, and nature of the product)

4. **What's the big idea**<br>
    Big ideas come from the unconscious. These are the questions to recognize a big idea:
    - Did it make me gasp when I first saw it?
    - Do I wish I had thought of it myself?
    - Is it unique?
    - Does it fit the strategy of perfection?
    - Could it be used for 30 years?

5. **Make the product the hero**<br>
    There are no dull products, only dull writers. <br>Explain the virtues more persuasively than competitors and differentiate it by the style of advertising.

6. **'The positively good'**<br>
    Not necessary to convince consumers that the product is superior to its competitors, but to create a confidence that the product is positively good.

7. **Repeat your winners**<br>
    Repeat good advertisement until it stops selling.

8. **Word of mouth**<br>
    word-of-mouth advertising by spreading anecdotes.

9. **Down with committees**<br>
    avoid committees

10. **Ambition**<br>
    try hard, that might double client's sales

11. **Pursuit of knowledge**<br>
    Practical knowledge rather than theory to make ads that are not set in reverse. Observe how little the plus minus factors change.

12. **The lessons of direct response**<br>
    General advertisers v/s direct-response advertisers. <br>Good advertisement isn't about how charming, witty and warm it is, but the one which sells.

13. **The cult of 'creativity'**<br>
    If it doesn't sell, it's not creative. <br>Creativity doesn't mean originality, in fact originality is the most dangerous word in advertising.s

14. **what about sex?**<br>
    stay away from showing irrelevant sex on ads.


This is a great book, and I thouroughly enjoyed reading it so far. I'm going to read the rest of it so soon.
