This article gives a walkdown through setting up of **HTTPS protocol for localhost using NGINX** in OSX (10.11.5).

(What the.. why? yeah even I don't know what is the purpose of encrypting & securing connections to my own localhost ðŸ˜œ. Well, I tried it when I was attempting to learn NGINX SSL configs).


# Prerequisites:

### 1. openssl
OSX by default comes with [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/).

```zsh
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016
```


### 2. nginx

Install:

```shell
$ brew install nginx
$ nginx -v
nginx version: nginx/1.10.1
```

### 3. a local server

Start your local development server.
(For eg: this can be just an index.html file with 'hello world' inside `/local_website`).

```shell
$ cd /local_website
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Optionally you can add an alias to your local_website in `/etc/hosts`

```config
127.0.0.1 local.website.dev
```

# Setting Up HTTPS for localhost

Websites need an SSL certificate to work on HTTPS. Usually it is signed & issued by CAs(Certificate Authorities). We will generate a self-signed certificate for our local testing.
<br><br>

### STEP 1: Generate Self-signed SSL Certificate

Openssl can generate a self-signed SSL certificate & private key pair with the following command (generated files will be in the current directory).

```shell
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt
```

This command will ask for the following info:

- Country Name
- State or Province Name
- Locality Name
- Organization Name
- Organizational Unit Name
- **Common Name**<sup>*</sup>
- Email Address

> **Common Name** value should be the domain name of your website.
> here it is `local.website.dev`
> If you have multiple sub domains, use a wildcard `*.website.dev`


The generated certificate will be in x509 container format with SHA256 signature algorithm, 2048bit RSA authentication key and is valid for 365 days.

 **[OPTIONAL]**: *If you want to view the contents of encoded certificate, do this:*

```shell
$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in localhost.crt
```
<br>

### STEP 2: Trust authority of the certificate

When browsers get the certificat from server, the authenticity is verified by checking with existing CAs. Browser has a list of trusted CAs by default, if the certificate issuer is not there, then browser will be showing a security warning 'untrusted connection'.

Our generated certificate is self signed, so browser will give security warning. In order to bypass that, we will manually verify the trust of certificate.

In OSX, you can do that in Keychain access as shown below: (or, open keychain access ui and add cerificate there).

```shell
$ sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/file/localhost.crt
```

*Note: this will work only on chrome & safari, because those browsers check keychain access to get list of CAs. Firefox stores its own list of trusted CAs in the browser, so firefox will still throw the security error.*

### STEP 3: Configure &amp; Reload nginx

Here is a sample nginx configuration you can make use of. Save its as `nginx_custom.conf`

```nginx
events {}
http {
    upstream backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
    server {
        server_name local.website.dev;
        rewrite ^(.*) https://local.website.dev$1 permanent;
    }
    server {
        listen               443;
        ssl                  on;
        ssl_certificate      /path/to/file/localhost.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  /path/to/file/localhost.key;
        ssl_ciphers          HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
        server_name          local.website.dev;
        location / {
            proxy_pass  http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```


Start/Reload nginx

```shell
# START nginx
$ sudo nginx -c /path/to/file/nginx_custom.conf

# RELOAD nginx
$ sudo nginx -c /path/to/file/nginx_custom.conf -s reload
```

<br>

## Final step

Access [https://local.website.dev](https://local.website.dev), you can see that little green padlock icon <i class="fa fa-lock" style="color: #94C867"></i> in the address bar. Yes, your local website is on HTTPS now!
