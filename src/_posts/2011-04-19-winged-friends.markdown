One of my favourite hobbies during the summer vacation is bird watching. The world of winged friends is really amazing, I canâ€™t express through words that how much it give pleasure to me. Their wide variety of colours, sweet voices, cute beaks, soft feathers, and above all, their wings which enable them to fly over the sky... everything make me so jealous of them.

Jungle Babbler, Indian Treepie, Black Drongo, Indian Oriole, Wire tailed swallow, Bulbul, Magpie Robin, Roseringed Parakeet, Indian Woodpecker, Common Kingfisher, Indian Koel, Yellow Throated, Tailor bird, Jungle crow, House crow, Common Myna, Paradise Flycatcher, Green Warbler, Eagle, Sunbird,  Heron, ... the list is endless!

But for the past 2 years, the major change i noticed around my house is the abrupt decrement in the number of birds. The concrete forest destroyed all greenary. Unpredictable climatic changes and deforestation destroyed all of their lives.

Vishu came once again as every year, was waiting for Vishupakshi(Cuculus micropterus). But it never came this year. Its so painful to realise that i am losing those winged friends forever..
