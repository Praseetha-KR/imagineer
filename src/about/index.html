        <p>Hi I'm <strong>Praseetha KR</strong>. A programmer &amp; designer from Bangalore.</p>

        <p>Mostly geek-ish, introvert in general, living in &lt;current timezone - 12hr&gt;. I love programming, travel, photography, electronics, physics.. and almost all kinds of breaking-and-making of stuff! I'm a skateboarding noob, Minecraft addict, occasional runner.. oh yeah anime fan too.</p>

        <p>I work at <a target="_blank" href="http://eventifier.com">Eventifier</a> where we are building a socialmedia aggregation platform. Previously I had worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a>, which create discussion spaces for geeks. Almost 4 years of career in web development, architecting &amp; design.</p>

        <p>I do <a href="https://github.com/Praseetha-KR">code</a> most of the time and occasionally <a href="https://twitter.com/void_imagineer">tweet</a>. I'm one of those who does time travel with laptop if wifi &amp; coffee are available!</p>
