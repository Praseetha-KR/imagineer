        <p>Hi I'm <strong>Praseetha</strong>. A frontend developer who is on a secret mission to explore the world of programming. Mostly geek-ish, introvert in general, totally living on current timezone - 12hr. I love travel, photography, electronics, physics.. aand almost all kinds of breaking-and-making of stuff!. I'm a skateboarding noob, Minecraft addict &amp; occasional runner.</p>

        <p>I work at <a target="_blank" href="http://eventifier.com">Eventifier</a> where we are building a socialmedia aggregation platform. Previously I had worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a>, which create discussion spaces for geeks. Almost 4 years of career in web development, architecting &amp; design.</p>

        <p>I'm one of those who does time travel with laptop if wifi &amp; coffee are available! I do <a href="https://github.com/Praseetha-KR">code</a> most of the time and occasionally <a href="https://twitter.com/void_imagineer">tweet</a>.</p>
