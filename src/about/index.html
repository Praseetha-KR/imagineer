</header>
<p>Hi! I'm Praseetha. A frontend developer and designer from Bangalore.</p>
<p>I'm currently working at <a target="_blank" href="http://eventifier.com">Eventifier</a>. I had worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a> before. I graduated with B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering from NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad (University of Calicut) in 2012.</p>
<p>Besides computers I love photography, electronics, physics and almost all kinds of breaking-and-making of stuff!</p>
