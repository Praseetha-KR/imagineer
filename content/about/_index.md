I'm Praseetha KR, a software engineer specialized in web technologies, based in Bangalore. Currently I work at AppKnox as a Software Architect.

Mostly geek-ish, introvert in general, living in `<current timezone - 12hr`. I love programming, photography, anime, electronics, physics.. and almost all kind of breaking-and-making of stuff!

I write [code](https://github.com/Praseetha-KR) most of the time and occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/void_imagineer). I'm one of those who does time travel with laptop if wifi & coffee are available! â˜• ðŸ’»
