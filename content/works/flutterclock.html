        <h3>Facts&nbsp;Clock</h3>
        <div>This was my initial idea, showing a random trivia for the time digits shown on the clock. The top bar represents seconds progress and the ':' blinks on each second. This clockface has light & dark themes.</div>

        <h3>Graph&nbsp;Calculator&nbsp;Clock</h3>
        <div>This was my final submission for the challenge. Current hour is represented in a graph paper, with seconds filling each cell. Progress of the hours for current day is shown by buttons of a calculator. The weather is displayed in the solar panel and the HH:MM:ss time is shown on LED panel of the calculator.</div>
