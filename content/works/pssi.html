            <h3>Logo&nbsp;Design</h3>
            <div>Initially I proposed a logo with reflective python heads with color similar to Indian flag. This did not get approval because it did not comply with PSF's logo guidelines because of the alteration of python logo, which I was unaware of at that point of time. Then I proposed few variartions without python logo, using interconnected quotes/speech-bubbles/cards in blue + yellow combinations (symbolizing python communinty) as well as a simple one with python logo. The later one got approved.</div>
