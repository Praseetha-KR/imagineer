I was in a Mosh session on a remote server and tried to do scroll using trackpad. Surprisingly instead of getting the scrolled content of the remote shell, it showed buffered content of my system's shell!

I opened up tmux inside the mosh session thinking may be it would help. Nope the same issue.

Local tmux as well has the same issue. The scoll mode (`ctrl` `B` `[`) in tmux with keyboard navigation worked as expected (in remote as well).

## The fix

Appraently there is a quick fix with iTerm2 in Mac.

1. Goto **iTerm2 > Preferences > Advanced**
2. In Mouse section, set ***Scroll wheel sends arrow keys when in alternate screen mode*** to `Yes`

<div>

        <figcaption>iTerm advanced preferences</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

Done!

Now the content will get scrolled correctly within tmux window pane in **scoll mode**.

Although mosh scrolling issue is not fixed (now mosh scroll gives walk through commands history), tmux mouse scrolling fix, indirectly fixed my issue. So,  yay! ðŸŽ‰
